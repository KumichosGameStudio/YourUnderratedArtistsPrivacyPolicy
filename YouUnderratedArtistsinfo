Privacy Policy & Purpose. -Your Underrated Artists-

-Purpose of the Service-

This is Your Underrated Artists.

It is a discovery platform for underrated artists, built on the following principles:
Recommendations are completely random
There are no likes, ratings, comments, or ranking systems
Artists are not compared against one another
The goal is simply to be seen, without pressure or evaluation

Additionally, the platform includes a unique concept called “graduation”:
When an artist reaches 77,777 subscribers, they automatically graduate and are removed from the platform
This ensures the space remains dedicated to truly emerging and underrated creators

The intention of this service is not to replace existing platforms or algorithms,
but to create a small, quiet entry point where artists can be discovered
without noise, competition, or judgment.
